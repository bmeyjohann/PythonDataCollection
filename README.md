# PythonDatasetCollection

This directory contains the image capture script and dataset collection script.
All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed using this file.
If desired, a docker image can be created from this file. However, the container would need camera access.
So far, I did not manage to do that. This is why I did not use docker for the data collection.
